DESCRIPTION:

This project focuses on API integration and data visualization using Python, aimed at providing practical experience in working with real-time data and visual analytics. The OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch 5-day weather forecast data for a selected city, such as Chennai. Using the requests library, the Python script connects to the API endpoint, retrieves JSON-formatted forecast data, and extracts relevant details like temperature and timestamps at 3-hour intervals. The data is then processed and visualized using the matplotlib library, which generates a clear and informative line chart representing the changes in temperature over the forecast period. This visual representation allows users to quickly understand trends and fluctuations in weather conditions, making the data more meaningful and easier to interpret. The deliverables include a fully functional Python script and a saved image of the temperature plot (weather_forecast.png). Through this task, the project highlights essential Python skills such as API handling, JSON data parsing, and creating data visualizations. It also demonstrates how external data sources can be used to build simple yet powerful dashboards, a skill widely used in data science and software development.
